## Overview

This project involves launching an AI startup that deploys sensors in business environments to collect and analyze data. This data helps organization gain insights from activities such as peopleâ€™s interactions and traffic flows. The current focus is on aiding a city traffic department to improve traffic management using data from drones. The challenge includes building a scalable data warehouse using technologies PostgreSQL, DBT, Airflow, and Redash, employing an ELT framework to ensure efficient data querying for future projects.

### Features
- Data Collection: Integration with swarm UAVs and static cameras to collect real-time traffic data.
- Data Warehouse: Scalable storage in PostgreSQL, designed to support high-volume data from diverse sources.
- Data Transformation: Utilizing DBT to implement ELT processes for efficient data transformation directly within the data warehouse.
- Data Visualization: Dashboards in Redash providing actionable insights into traffic patterns and management.
